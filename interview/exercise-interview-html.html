    		<p><b>Where do you look for inspiration online for design?</b>
    			<br>Inspiration just comes from my daily life. 
    		<p><b>How is art making online different then art making offline?</b>
    		<br>
				Online: using a computer can make your work more elaborate and precise, more control and details. Easy to edit and erase. However, it's less nature with fault settings than hand making stuffs.
				Offline: can give you more surprising outputs and more fun with the process. Nicer texture and human nature. Imperfect can make more unique staffs.
