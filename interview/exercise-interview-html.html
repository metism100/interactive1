    	<h2>Conversation</h2>
    		<p> <b> How does the web impact graphic design? </b>
    			<br>As a graphic designer, we need to also shoot our work and sell it. We need to let our audience know our designs so we want to have a website to show it. </p>
    		<p> <b> What is your experience of the web? </b> 
    			<br>Online web can just make you search anything you want anywhere or anytime. It makes life easier. It lets people get closer because of some - <br> social applications. </p>
    		<p><b>Do you remember what it was first like being on the web?</b>
    			<br>I really canâ€™t remember too long. The first time I got through the web should be at 1st grade. (used parents computer)</p>
    		<p><b>Where do you look for inspiration online for design?</b>
    			<br>Inspiration just comes from my daily life. 
    		<p><b>How is art making online different then art making offline?</b>
    		<br>
				Online: using a computer can make your work more elaborate and precise, more control and details. Easy to edit and erase. However, it's less nature with <br> fault settings than hand making stuffs.
				Offline: can give you more surprising outputs and more fun with the process. Nicer texture and human nature. <br> Imperfect can make more unique staffs.
